I am also member of the Center for the Study of French Language and Literature ([CELLF](https://cellf.cnrs.fr/)), UMR 8599, and of the Observatory of Texts, Ideas and Corpora ([ObTIC](https://obtic.sorbonne-universite.fr/)).

Research Interests
======
My research focuses on Digital Humanities (DH), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning (DL). I am particularly interested in the methods of dissemination, sharing and valorization of heritage collections through the prism of Digital Humanities in order to track the circulation of knowledge.

Within the scope of my PhD thesis I am currently working on the tracking of the circulation of the medical discourse of Jean-Martin Charcot, founder of modern neurology in the XIX century.

**DH**: optical character recognition (OCR), handwritten text recognition (HTR),
data structuring in XML-TEI format, publication of queryable digital editions.

**NLP**: text mining, computational linguistics.

**DL**: Transformers Models
