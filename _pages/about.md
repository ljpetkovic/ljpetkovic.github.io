Research Interests
======
My research focuses on Digital Humanities, Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning. I am particularly interested in the methods of dissemination, sharing and valorization of heritage collections through the prism of Digital Humanities in order to track the circulation of knowledge.

Within the scope of my PhD thesis I am currently working on the tracking of the circulation of the medical discourse of Jean-Martin Charcot, founder of modern neurology in the XIX century.

**Digital Humanities**: optical character recognition (OCR), handwritten text recognition (HTR),
data structuring in XML-TEI format, publication of queryable digital editions.

**Natural Language Processing**: text mining, computational linguistics.

**Deep Learning**: Transformers Models
