My name is Ljudmila PetkoviÄ‡, I am a PhD student in [French and Comparative Literature (Doctoral School 019)](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/node/2040) at the Sorbonne University in Paris (France), specializing in the field of Digital Humanities. I am also member of the Center for the Study of French Language and Literature ([CELLF](https://cellf.cnrs.fr/)), <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">UMR 8599</span>, and of the Observatory of Texts, Ideas and Corpora ([ObTIC](https://obtic.sorbonne-universite.fr/)).

I began my PhD thesis in October 2021 under the supervision of Prof. Dr Glenn Roe and Dr Motasem Alrahabi (Sorbonne University), which is financed by the [OPUS](https://institut-opus.sorbonne-universite.fr/) institute (Observatory of Heritage of Sorbonne University). In parallel, I am completing my [Certificate of Specialization in Linguistics](https://www.unige.ch/lettres/linguistique/program/postgrade/) at the University of Geneva (Switzerland), Faculty of Humanities, Department of Linguistics.

## <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Research Interests</span>

My research focuses on Digital Humanities, Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning. I am particularly interested in the methods of dissemination, sharing and valorization of heritage collections through the prism of Digital Humanities in order to track the circulation of knowledge.

Within the scope of my PhD thesis I am currently working on the tracking of the circulation of the medical discourse of Jean-Martin Charcot, founder of modern neurology in the XIX<sup>e</sup> century.
